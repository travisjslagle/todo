OVERVIEW:

This to-do list app is very minimal currently. You are able to add to-do items easily using the input field at the top. This should populate that item into the accordian list of to-dos. If you click on the list, it should expand showing the to-do's extra details (a category and a due date) and buttons to both edit the to-do and mark it complete.


DIRECTION:

I tried to lay the foundation to expand functionality of the app from a simple to-do list, to a more full-featured productivity app. With a little more polish, I think sorting the tasks by categories and due dates would add a lot for the user to interact with, and may actually help organize some people.


SHORTCOMINGS:

I could not get the stubbed out backend working, and after about 45 min I copied and modified a previous Express backend that I had worked on in plain JavaScript, as TypeScript was adding to my confusion there and I wanted to focus on getting functionality in the frontend.

Also, marking the task complete (which probably should have been my first goal) does not currently work. And there is no sorting. These are the things I would (and probably will) work out first with more time. Then, expanding how categories and due dates function, and work as sorting parameters.



Many thanks for the ability to submit a challenge solution -- it has given me a lot to think about already. I appreciate the time that it takes to review these submissions is non-trivial, so thanks.

Best,
